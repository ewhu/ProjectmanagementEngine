* **Integrations**: Integrate with existing systems and tools, such as Git, Jenkins, and Slack
* **Reporting and Analytics**: Generate detailed reports and analytics to track project performance and progress

**Technology Stack**

* **Python 3.9**: The primary programming language used for development
* **Flask**: A lightweight web framework used for building the RESTful API
* **SQLAlchemy**: A SQL toolkit used for database interactions and ORM
* **PostgreSQL**: A robust relational database management system used for storing project data
* **React**: A JavaScript library used for building the frontend web application
* **Material-UI**: A CSS framework used for styling and theming the frontend application

**Installation**

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/ewhu/ProjectmanagementEngine.git`
2. Install the required dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Create a PostgreSQL database and update the `database.conf` file with the database credentials
4. Run the database migrations: `python manage.py db migrate`
5. Start the Flask development server: `python manage.py run`

**Configuration**

* **Environment Variables**: Set the following environment variables:
